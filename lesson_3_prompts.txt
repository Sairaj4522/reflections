When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  First thing will be to collaborate with others with a project may be its an open source project or
  another projct you want to share code with your colleagues and also its better to have your project
   hosted on some server, which will allow to have a backup in case of loss of local data.
