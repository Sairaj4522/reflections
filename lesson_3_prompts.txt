When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  First thing will be to collaborate with others with a project may be its an open source project or
  another projct you want to share code with your colleagues and also its better to have your project
   hosted on some server, which will allow to have a backup in case of loss of local data. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Well, if pull was automated then push should also be automated and even commit and all 
	other stuff we do with git on the command line. But, they are not because its about 
	control over a repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork is a cool feature on GitHub which lets you clone some repositories into your account on their server.
	this is different to creating branches or cloning a repo, in a way that fork happens on the GitHub account
	(more specifically on GitHub server/system) whereas, branches can be created on local repo as well on GitHub hosted repo,
	and cloning just copies the repo from other source to local system.
	Hence when I want to make some changes on a ongoing project on GitHub I will fork it since I wouldn't have explicit rights
	over that repo project. So I will have to get it on my account, and to work on the code I'll have to clone the forked repo
	and start working on it, here I can also create branches to try out a new feature or to bug fix.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	That way git will be able to know how/where to merge in the branch hierarchy. More accurately
	git will able to decide whether current pull is a fast forward merge or conflict where one commit
	isn't there in other, eg. in local repo you have a commit yet to push and simultaneously there's
	another commit on remote side which may have been led by your own actions or an collaborater have
	done that.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Word to word, in person, over chat client, using mails and other communication stuff.
	But without Git or GitHub it would be insanely tedious.
