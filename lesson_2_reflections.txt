What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A hidden directory is created named as .git where git holds all the info and repository in.
	This is the initial step if one wants to use git integration for his/her project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It is different in the sense that git uses it as the intermediate stage between the working directory and the repository. It enables a convinient way for git to hold various files added per functionality or logical change.
